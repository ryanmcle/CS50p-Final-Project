This is a very basic project
My intro to coding projection essentially and to get some experience with 
re's, numpy, sympy, matplotlib

for arithmetics:
Input is required to be in the form 1 + 2 + 3 * 4 - 5 ... + 4

for trigonometrics:
This part just returns the trig value of angles, enter the angle in degrees and receive the value

for matrices:
You can add or subtract these here, pretty easy to understand whats going on in the terminal

for graphs:
enter the f(x) function and you will receive a plot.png file, it will delete past graphs
